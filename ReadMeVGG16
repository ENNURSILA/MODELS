After tray detection, I cropped the tray and sent it to the vgg16 model.
 
"EveningTray"  "BreakfastTray" classification.

If the result is  EveningTray , dinner food yolo works. 
After, MainCourseClassification.ipynb This model works if the food type is "Main Course"  I cropped it again and sent it to the new classification model.((Stew,Rice,Pasta,Beans))
       SoupClassification.ipynb This model works if the food type is "Soup"  (RedSoup, WhiteSoup) tomato soup, lentil soup in the future. Since there are not many soup images, I separated them by color. 


If the result is BreakfastTray , breakfast  yolo works.
After, breakfastClassification.ipynb This model works if the food type is "breakfast product"  I cropped it again and sent it to the new classification model.((Cheese,Olives,Cucumber,Tomato))
Note: I am improving the breakfast section.
